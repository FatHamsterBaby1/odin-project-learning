        <h1>Homework</h1>
        <p>I will learn about 3 new tags that go into the head section that is not the meta or title element. For each new tag that I learn, I will create
            a new heading for each tag.<br> Under the tag I will write couple sentences explaining what the tag does. Then I will commit this code to my <b>local</b> repository.
        </p> 
        <H2><em>Style Tag</em></H2>  
        <p>The <b> style </b> tag is used to define style information for a document. The <b>style</b> tag displays the appearance and different characteristics of a website or page.<br> Examples of this are font styles, colors, and spacing.</p>
        <h2><em>Link Tag</em></h2>
        <p>The <b>Link</b> tag allows you to click and interact with an external resource within your document or webpage. The link tag is used to bring users to another page that is filled with content of some kind. <br> These links can bring a user to different things such as videos, images, and, even other websites.</p>
