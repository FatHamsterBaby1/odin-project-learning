        <h1>Homework</h1>
        <p>I will learn about 3 new tags that go into the head section that is not the meta or title element. For each new tag that I learn, I will create
            a new heading for each tag. Under the tag I will write couple sentences explaining what the tag does. Then I will commit this code to my <b>local</b> repository.
